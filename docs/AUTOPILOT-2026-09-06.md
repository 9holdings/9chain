# A1 autonomous development window

- Start: 2026-09-06 16:23:12 UTC (20:23:12 Dubai).
- Hard work deadline: 2026-09-07 02:23:12 UTC (06:23:12 Dubai).
- Heartbeat: `n-ng-c-p-a1-trong-10-gi`, current task, every 15 minutes.
  A final scheduled wake after the work deadline is for reporting/pausing only.
- Local development/build/test/commit authorized. Public deployment/publication,
  validator/genesis changes, public transactions and data deletion still require review.
- Worktree scope: main. Leave web-home, audit and other running services alone.
- Do not promise ten hours of uninterrupted runtime: local scheduling depends on
  the machine/app staying available and account capacity.

## Priorities

1. Verify build inputs and reproducible local validation before new features.
2. Review console creation/recovery for lost state, duplicate operations and stale RPC readiness.
3. Implement bounded fixes with HTTP/local integration tests and negative controls.
4. Prepare resource measurements and public deployment acceptance/rollback steps.
5. At deadline, stop starting changes, record final commit/test/limitations summary.

## Evidence and next action

- Baseline commit: `8192778`; fork tree `387238778dda96d58cabe6f9ddd7097e208b69e9`, clean.
- Docker engine is reachable. Many unrelated containers run on this machine;
  do not stop them or assume default ports/resources are free.
- Console HTTP tests (real process, fake node): options 56/56; governance 55/55.
  These verify API wiring and failure paths, not consensus or a live rollout.
- Found root Docker ignore policy does not exclude local operational config,
  network key directories or node_modules from the supplied context. Added a
  Dockerfile-specific source allowlist. Real Docker synthetic probe passes:
  3 required paths included, 11 unrelated paths excluded. Removing the policy
  exposes synthetic operational files as expected. Evidence in ignored
  `work/node-context-MMRsDJ`; no real keys used.
- Next: commit the verified context policy, then run a bounded Linux fork
  build without overwriting existing image tags or altering genesis/validator state.
